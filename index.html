      <h1>WALKABLE WICHITA: LESSONS FROM JEFF SPECK</h1>
      <p>On March 4, 2025, urban planner Jeff Speck visited <span class="highlight-word">WaveICT</span> for the “Downtown Wichita Action Plan Kickoff Open House.” There, he gave a talk inspired by his 2018 book Walkable City Rules: 101 Steps to Making Places Better.  “What guidelines could the city follow to make downtown more walkable?”, he asked during his talk.</p>
      <p>
      	Beginning with this article, Bike Walk Wichita will publish a series that looks at Speck’s written rules and, much like he did in his talk, apply them to Wichita. Walkable cities prioritize local schools and parks, invest in attainable housing downtown, understand induced demand, and create congestion-price city centers. When cities apply such rules, they create more wealth and improve the health of their residents. Walkable cities foster close-knit communities, promote equity, and combat climate change. Such advances are in accord with the City of Wichita’s mission statement: “keep Wichita safe, grow our economy, build and maintain dependable infrastructure, and provide conditions for living well.”  The series is intended to show how Speck’s rules could apply to the city and spark conversation about what might make Wichita a better place to live. 
      </p>
      <p>	This series will do more than provide a set of recommendations, though. It will also provide historical context, detailing the individuals and decisions responsible for contributing to Wichita’s built environment. According to Speck, one-way streets are bad for walkability. But who decided to make First and Second one-way at all? Douglas has more lanes than needed. But why is it so wide in the first place? The series’ articles will be organized around each of Speck’s suggestions and describe the advent of Wichita’s zoning ordinances in the 1920s. They will document the debates over one-way streets during the 1950s, the embrace of angled parking in Delano in the 2000s, and the fight against the relocation of urban high schools in the 2010s. </p>
      <p>	The purpose of these histories will be to show the ways in which Wichitans both undermined and embraced Speck’s rules. Traffic engineers, city council members, activists, and residents alike have all added to the look and feel of the city. Of course, governmental officials have the final say in how Speck’s rules might be applied. However, as these articles will suggest, citizens hold immense power. The city is not a static object that grew out of nothing––made in the distant past and set in stone. Instead, it is often subject to the ideas and opinions of everyday people. Residents can attend their District Advisory Board or Metropolitan Area Planning Commission meetings. They can volunteer to organize “bike buses” at their local schools. Or they can participate in their neighborhood associations and draft neighborhood plans. </p>
      <p>	Such civic engagement is vital. Wichita was not made in a vacuum. The rest of the articles in this series will show how, rule by rule, various institutions, engineers, developers, and residents have designed the city. And with some guidelines provided by Speck, it will provide ideas on how we can remake it and improve it as well. </p>

    <h1>RULE 9: ELIMINATE SINGLE-USE ZONING FROM WICHITA ORDINANCES</h1>
    <p>	Wichita’s City Commissioners in the 1920s had an idea, one shared by many other city leaders across the nation. Wichita was going to create a zoning ordinance. It was a decision that would profoundly impact the city’s walkability. </p>
    <p>	Before the advent of zoning in the 1920s, a city or urban era might develop in a “helter-skelter, village-like, indiscriminate manner.”  This meant that an individual could build a repair shop next to a residence. Apartment buildings could be built right on the lot line of an adjacent property, depriving it of light, air, and privacy. Churches could be next to loud factories. For several Wichitans, this was not ideal. Some were concerned about their property values. Why purchase land and contribute to the growth of an 80,000-person city when your neighbor might later be a filling station or industrial plant?  Even something as innocuous as a grocery store could impose upon a “fine residence district.”  Others were interested in Progressive Era reforms. Sufficient access to light, air, and protection against nuisance was a “human right” argued the Wichita Beacon in 1922.</p>
    <p>	To fix this issue, Wichita’s commissioners implemented a plan that divided the city into several zones. Zone A was restricted to single and two-family residences, churches, schools, and libraries. Zone B permitted apartments. Zone Cs and D were reserved for commercial and light industrial uses. Industries which made loud noises, created dense smoke, or released foul odors were confined to Zone E. For the most part, they were all distinct from one another. Fertilizer plants, glue factories, gunpowder factories, incinerators, rock crushers, and sauerkraut factories were located as far from residential and retail districts as possible.  Commercial houses were no longer interspersed within residential areas. Instead, the ordinance relegated them to the corners of main arterial roads. </p>
    <p>	The zoning ordinance, which passed in March 14, 1922, solved a problem. It also created a new one, impacting the walkability and density of the city for a century to come. Just look at the issues that arose the year of its passing alone. One individual was denied the opportunity to build a three-floor apartment house that would accommodate 24 families.  A group of developers were turned away when they realized College Hill did not permit apartment living.  A warrant was issued for the arrest of a shop owner who was operating a store at 1937 McCormick, a property that was in Zone A.  </p>
    <p>	Sometimes the zoning ordinance caused problems for longtime inhabitants. The property owner of a parcel on the intersection of Green Street and Douglas Avenue declined to renovate their dilapidated storefront because of zoning restrictions. The ordinance required any new building to be located 30 feet from the sidewalk. The proprietor lived in a bungalow in the back of the lot, so new construction would encroach on their living quarters. Plus, they could not rebuild it as a store since it was located in a residential area.  After a fire destroyed George Drake’s grocery store at 107 West Funston, the zoning ordinance prohibited it from being rebuilt as well. </p>
    <p>	Wichita’s zoning ordinance has expanded since it was first implemented in 1922. It still protects Wichita’s residents as it was originally intended. However, it also comes with the same problems that were first seen more than a century ago. As urban planner Jeff Speck notes in Walkable City Rules: 101 Steps to Making Better Places, “if nothing is close to anything different, and the only connection is a single fat roadway, then the population is automatically conscripted into driving.”  What has resulted is that a “city of neighborhoods” has been replaced by a “city of zones.”  Say a Wichitan wants to visit, or even open, a restaurant. The current ordinance <span class="highlight-word">only allows the existence of a restaurant in 26 percent of the city’s available land area</span>. Furthermore, much like it did in the 1920s, it relegates such businesses to main intersections on the periphery of residential areas. The placement of microbreweries or indoor recreation and entertainment centers is even more restricted. </p>
    <p>	“Mix the uses,” Speck argues.  The elimination of single-use zoning, the implementation of more specific zoning, and the expansion of mixed-use development would contribute to help solving this issue. The Wichita Zoning Code explicitly defines the “Central Business District (CBD)” as a zone designated for “mixed use.”  However, such zones do not need to be exclusively downtown. The developer who owns the land at the southeast corner of Central and Oliver is hoping to rezone the property as a “CBD.” This allows for the construction of a building that has commercial properties on the bottom floor and residential units above. “Planned Unit Developments” (PUDs) is another special type of zoning district that can be granted. This has led to the construction of Uptown Landing on Douglas and Hillside, a development with apartments existing next to coffee shops and directly above a restaurant and other commercial spaces.  </p>
    <p>Such developments and zone changes improve walkability as they mix dense housing with retail and commercial spaces. Wichita’s zoning laws have been in effect for more than a century, separating the city into district areas. Without losing sight of the benefits of zoning, it is about time to address its limitations. </p>
