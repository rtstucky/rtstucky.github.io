      <h1>WALKABLE WICHITA: LESSONS FROM JEFF SPECK</h1>
      <p>On March 4, 2025, urban planner Jeff Speck visited <span class="highlight-word">WaveICT</span> for the “Downtown Wichita Action Plan Kickoff Open House.” There, he gave a talk inspired by his 2018 book Walkable City Rules: 101 Steps to Making Places Better.  “What guidelines could the city follow to make downtown more walkable?”, he asked during his talk.</p>
      <p>
      	Beginning with this article, Bike Walk Wichita will publish a series that looks at Speck’s written rules and, much like he did in his talk, apply them to Wichita. Walkable cities prioritize local schools and parks, invest in attainable housing downtown, understand induced demand, and create congestion-price city centers. When cities apply such rules, they create more wealth and improve the health of their residents. Walkable cities foster close-knit communities, promote equity, and combat climate change. Such advances are in accord with the City of Wichita’s mission statement: “keep Wichita safe, grow our economy, build and maintain dependable infrastructure, and provide conditions for living well.”  The series is intended to show how Speck’s rules could apply to the city and spark conversation about what might make Wichita a better place to live. 
      </p>
      <p>	This series will do more than provide a set of recommendations, though. It will also provide historical context, detailing the individuals and decisions responsible for contributing to Wichita’s built environment. According to Speck, one-way streets are bad for walkability. But who decided to make First and Second one-way at all? Douglas has more lanes than needed. But why is it so wide in the first place? The series’ articles will be organized around each of Speck’s suggestions and describe the advent of Wichita’s zoning ordinances in the 1920s. They will document the debates over one-way streets during the 1950s, the embrace of angled parking in Delano in the 2000s, and the fight against the relocation of urban high schools in the 2010s. </p>
      <p>	The purpose of these histories will be to show the ways in which Wichitans both undermined and embraced Speck’s rules. Traffic engineers, city council members, activists, and residents alike have all added to the look and feel of the city. Of course, governmental officials have the final say in how Speck’s rules might be applied. However, as these articles will suggest, citizens hold immense power. The city is not a static object that grew out of nothing––made in the distant past and set in stone. Instead, it is often subject to the ideas and opinions of everyday people. Residents can attend their District Advisory Board or Metropolitan Area Planning Commission meetings. They can volunteer to organize “bike buses” at their local schools. Or they can participate in their neighborhood associations and draft neighborhood plans. </p>
      <p>	Such civic engagement is vital. Wichita was not made in a vacuum. The rest of the articles in this series will show how, rule by rule, various institutions, engineers, developers, and residents have designed the city. And with some guidelines provided by Speck, it will provide ideas on how we can remake it and improve it as well. </p>

    <h1>RULE 9: ELIMINATE SINGLE-USE ZONING FROM WICHITA ORDINANCES</h1>
    <p>	Wichita’s City Commissioners in the 1920s had an idea, one shared by many other city leaders across the nation. Wichita was going to create a zoning ordinance. It was a decision that would profoundly impact the city’s walkability. </p>
    <p>	Before the advent of zoning in the 1920s, a city or urban era might develop in a “helter-skelter, village-like, indiscriminate manner.”  This meant that an individual could build a repair shop next to a residence. Apartment buildings could be built right on the lot line of an adjacent property, depriving it of light, air, and privacy. Churches could be next to loud factories. For several Wichitans, this was not ideal. Some were concerned about their property values. Why purchase land and contribute to the growth of an 80,000-person city when your neighbor might later be a filling station or industrial plant?  Even something as innocuous as a grocery store could impose upon a “fine residence district.”  Others were interested in Progressive Era reforms. Sufficient access to light, air, and protection against nuisance was a “human right” argued the Wichita Beacon in 1922.</p>
    <p>	To fix this issue, Wichita’s commissioners implemented a plan that divided the city into several zones. Zone A was restricted to single and two-family residences, churches, schools, and libraries. Zone B permitted apartments. Zone Cs and D were reserved for commercial and light industrial uses. Industries which made loud noises, created dense smoke, or released foul odors were confined to Zone E. For the most part, they were all distinct from one another. Fertilizer plants, glue factories, gunpowder factories, incinerators, rock crushers, and sauerkraut factories were located as far from residential and retail districts as possible.  Commercial houses were no longer interspersed within residential areas. Instead, the ordinance relegated them to the corners of main arterial roads. </p>
    <p>	The zoning ordinance, which passed in March 14, 1922, solved a problem. It also created a new one, impacting the walkability and density of the city for a century to come. Just look at the issues that arose the year of its passing alone. One individual was denied the opportunity to build a three-floor apartment house that would accommodate 24 families.  A group of developers were turned away when they realized College Hill did not permit apartment living.  A warrant was issued for the arrest of a shop owner who was operating a store at 1937 McCormick, a property that was in Zone A.  </p>
    <p>	Sometimes the zoning ordinance caused problems for longtime inhabitants. The property owner of a parcel on the intersection of Green Street and Douglas Avenue declined to renovate their dilapidated storefront because of zoning restrictions. The ordinance required any new building to be located 30 feet from the sidewalk. The proprietor lived in a bungalow in the back of the lot, so new construction would encroach on their living quarters. Plus, they could not rebuild it as a store since it was located in a residential area.  After a fire destroyed George Drake’s grocery store at 107 West Funston, the zoning ordinance prohibited it from being rebuilt as well. </p>
    <p>	Wichita’s zoning ordinance has expanded since it was first implemented in 1922. It still protects Wichita’s residents as it was originally intended. However, it also comes with the same problems that were first seen more than a century ago. As urban planner Jeff Speck notes in Walkable City Rules: 101 Steps to Making Better Places, “if nothing is close to anything different, and the only connection is a single fat roadway, then the population is automatically conscripted into driving.”  What has resulted is that a “city of neighborhoods” has been replaced by a “city of zones.”  Say a Wichitan wants to visit, or even open, a restaurant. The current ordinance <span class="highlight-word">only allows the existence of a restaurant in 26 percent of the city’s available land area</span>. Furthermore, much like it did in the 1920s, it relegates such businesses to main intersections on the periphery of residential areas. The placement of microbreweries or indoor recreation and entertainment centers is even more restricted. </p>
    <p>	“Mix the uses,” Speck argues.  The elimination of single-use zoning, the implementation of more specific zoning, and the expansion of mixed-use development would contribute to help solving this issue. The Wichita Zoning Code explicitly defines the “Central Business District (CBD)” as a zone designated for “mixed use.”  However, such zones do not need to be exclusively downtown. The developer who owns the land at the southeast corner of Central and Oliver is hoping to rezone the property as a “CBD.” This allows for the construction of a building that has commercial properties on the bottom floor and residential units above. “Planned Unit Developments” (PUDs) is another special type of zoning district that can be granted. This has led to the construction of Uptown Landing on Douglas and Hillside, a development with apartments existing next to coffee shops and directly above a restaurant and other commercial spaces.  </p>
    <p>Such developments and zone changes improve walkability as they mix dense housing with retail and commercial spaces. Wichita’s zoning laws have been in effect for more than a century, separating the city into district areas. Without losing sight of the benefits of zoning, it is about time to address its limitations. </p>

    <h1>RULE 7: PUSH FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS</h1>
      <p>	Southeast High School needed improvements. Floors were cracked. Doorways had warped. Toilets were broken and ceiling tiles leaked.  It was overcrowded, beyond its ideal capacity with nearly 1,650 students.  It needed a new gym, a new fine arts facility, athletic fields, and expanded parking.  The school board could either refurbish the school, located at Edgemoor and Lincoln. Or, it could build a new one on 127th and Pawnee. In June 2013, board members voted unanimously to do the latter.  It was a decision that profoundly impacted students, parents, and the city, undermining individuals’ ability to walk to the school.</p>
      <p>	In 2012, 675 students at Southeast (about 43 percent) lived less than 2.5 miles from its location at 903 S. Edgemoor. About one-third of those students regularly walked.  For Don Landis, spokesperson for the group Save Southeast, this was a benefit. Kids had a chance to participate in after-school activities. Parents without automobile access could better reach the school when needed.  Tardies could be avoided, argued Gil Alvarez, USD 259’s assistant superintendent of secondary schools, because students had the opportunity to walk if they missed the bus or did not have a ride.  </p>
     <p>	Plus, notes Jeff Speck, urban planner and author of Walkable City Rules: 101 Steps to Making Better Places, “walking to school has been shown to improve both academic performance and well-being, as well as public health.” Schools are playgrounds and community centers. It is the “primary vehicle through which families get to know each other and form a circle of friends.”  Little wonder that State Representative Jim Ward protested the move. “Schools are a key part of any community. This is important not only for the school board but the entire city of Wichita. You could create a whole section of the city that will die, it will just go away, if decision-makers look just at cost and nothing else,” he cautioned. </p>
      <p>	While the old Southeast was conveniently located at Edgemoor and Lincoln, the new location deprived students the ability to walk. When it opened, only about 128 students (about 9 percent) lived within 2.5 miles of the school. Usually, this means such students would not be offered busing and would be required to walk or find their own transportation. However, since the area lacks sidewalks, or otherwise required students to walk on a roadway where the posted speed is above 40 miles per hour, these students qualified for what the school district calls “hazardous-route” busing.  This was not atypical. In 2016, about 3,600 students in the district required hazardous-route transportation. Such numbers had increased nearly 40 percent over the previous five years, particularly as the district opened new schools in remote areas. In 2016, only 250 students lived within 2.5 miles of Heights High School. But they could not safely walk to school and the district was forced to provide bussing to all of them.  </p>
      <p>	Transportation costs have increased as a result. In 2018, the school district paid Wichita Transit $126,000 to operate three busses in the morning and afternoon that transport students to the new Southeast High School.  Southeast also required operation of 47 regular school buses, the second most in the district.  Wichitans had predicted this cost impact. Writing to the Wichita Eagle amidst the relocation discussions, one resident offered advice on how USD 259 could reduce its $27 million busing cost: “How about starting with making wise, logical, forward-thinking decisions, such as leaving Southeast High where it is and not building a school in a location that automatically forces an increase in transportation costs?” </p>
      <p>	Several residents were also concerned with more than just the budget. They even speculated the new location’s lack of walkability impacted graduation rates at Southeast. In 2013 it was 78 percent. But by 2018 it fell to 65.4 percent. Chase Billingham, a sociologist at Wichita State University, noted how attendance rates at the new location were quite high and that graduation was already declining well before the move. He cites the district’s stringent disciplinary sanctions as impacting students more than location.  </p>
      <p>	However, the new location certainly did not help either. “I know a lot of people who walk to school and for them it would be a lot harder. I feel like a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do the after-school programs because they wouldn’t have ways to get to and from school,” speculated one Southeast student before the relocation occurred.  Alvarez echoed those concerns, noting how “if a kid now does not make the bus and doesn’t have a car to get there, it’s not walking distance.”  Even residents chimed in. “No wonder the absentee rate is so high,” notes Marilyn DeBoer in a letter to the editor of the Eagle. “There is limited residential development near the school, whereas the old Southeast High was probably the centerpiece of the fully developed neighborhood it served … No one seems to care how early these kids may need to get up so they don’t miss the school bus, which is possibly their only way to go those seven miles out in the country to the new school. Or how much longer their day is going those seven miles back home.” </p>
      <p>	Southeast was not the only high school to relocate from a vibrant, urban, and walkable area to a suburban and rural one. In 2012, Northeast High School moved from 1847 North Chautaqua to 5550 North Lycee in Bel Aire. City council member Brandon Johnson, who attended Northeast, praised the school’s integration within the community at its old location. “If something happened in the morning––if my mom was sick or had to be at work early—I could walk to school and still be on time or slightly late … It was close enough that it was easy to get a friend to take me to school.”  Northeast students were similarly discouraged by the move. Kelton Fort put it plainly: “nobody wants to go all the way up to Bel Aire. We chose to come here.”  However, despite pushback from the neighborhood’s residents, Northeast moved. Southeast followed soon after. Both relocations placed the schools within areas that were at least 80 percent less dense.  </p>
      <p>	Cities should understand that “schools belong in neighborhoods,” argues Speck, and “locate them to be walkable and resist the urge to consolidate them into large facilities.”  Although Southeast and Northeast are not as walkable as they once were, Wichita High Schools East, North, and West serve as great inspirations. Among all other Wichita Public High schools, they are located in the densest neighborhoods with the most residences, buildings, and retail surrounding them. Keeping them there is not cheap, either. As of 2025, East and North have cost the district $60 million in repairs over the last three years.  But such repairs are necessary. The stories of Southeast and Northeast show what can happen when you rebuild. </p>
